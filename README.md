# onlyOnce
an open source puzzle game

This game is not finished yet, so don't expect something awsome ;)

## What is this game about ?
This is a puzzle game in which you control a player who has to find a way to exit rooms. To achieve it, you have to move on every tile once.. But only once !

## How to play it ?
Download the source, and compile it (just type "make" in your terminal). You may need to install SDL2 (apt-get install libsdl2-dev and apt install libsdl2-ttf-dev on debian).

## How can I help to develop it ?
Pick something on the todo.txt file, fork the repo, develop and make a pull request !
