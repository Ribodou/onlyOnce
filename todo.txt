check why valgrind say 225 bytes in 4 blocks (apparently it is becuase of SDL)
even with an empty program, it says:
==15621==    definitely lost: 225 bytes in 4 blocks
==15621==    indirectly lost: 1,728 bytes in 38 blocks
==15621==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==15621==    still reachable: 44,376 bytes in 466 blocks
==15621==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==15621== Reachable blocks (those to which a pointer was found) are not shown.
==15621== To see them, rerun with: --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all
==15621== 

================================================================================
Make an title screen and an intro that explain the game

================================================================================
Uses sounds ("crack" xhen the ice break, "plouf" when the player swim, "swip"
when he slip, etc.)

================================================================================
Use a true of open source sprites for the player.

================================================================================
Handle the camera (ie keep the player at the center of the sreen by changing the offset in pixel)

================================================================================
Make a menu, that you can acces via the "tab" key, that shows the levels you can play. When clicking on it, one should be able to play that level.

================================================================================
Create some subclass for the Case class, ie separate the breakable part from the others.

================================================================================
Creat a HUD that display the number of cases left to break on this level.
The HUD soudl also add the info on every "cross" (blocage) cases. This way, it
will be possible to add others "cross" cases, and the player will be able to figure which Case will open first.
